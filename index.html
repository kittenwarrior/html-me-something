        <h4>France: Paris and Nice</h4>
      </header>
      <p>
        Our trip started in Paris where we visited the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe,
        and famous museums like the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay and Musee de l'Orangerie.
        Our first day we walked over 10 miles, which probably wasn't the smartest
        idea but my sister was very excited to show us the city that she had been
        spending the past couple of months in and we were happy to be off the plane!
        <br>
        <br>
        Then we headed to Nice, France with it's beautiful rocky beaches.
        This stop was meant to be a relaxing one as we didn't spend very long in the city before heading to Italy.

        <h4>Italy: Cinque Terre, Florence, Rome and Venice</h4>
      </header>
      <p>
        After leaving France we headed towards the hilly villages of Cinque Terre in Italy.
        These villages were built into the mountain side coast and very beautiful to explore via the hiking paths.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next city was Florence, home to many of the renaissance masterpieces
        that I studied in my classes.  Here we explored the Duomo, Uffizi gallery, Galleria dell'Accademia,
        Museo Galileo, and the Medici Chapel.
        <br>
        <br>
        From Florence we went to Rome which was another city I studied a lot of during my latin classes.
        In Rome we went to Vatican City Museum, Sistine Chapel, Pantheon, Roman Forum, Roman Colosseum
        <br>
        <br>
        Our last city in Italy was Venice. Here we we explored the island of Burano,
        went on a couple boat rides, shopped in the Piazza San Marco and went on a gondola ride.

        <h4>Germany: Munich and Berlin</h4>
      </header>
      <p>
        The train ride from Venice to Munich was quite possibly the most beautiful one
        as we traveled between the Alps. When we arrived in Munich we took a free walking
        tour that took us to major sights in Munich. Starting in the Marienplatz square where
        we viewed the famous Glockenspiel, then to the Hofbrauhaus and several historical
        places where Hitler gave speeches. On our last day there we explored BMW Welt which
        a museum dedicated to BMW history and walked around the Olympiapark.
        <br>
        <br>
        After a night train we arrived at Berlin which is VERY different from Munich.
        In Munich the city itself still feels very old dispite much of it being destroyed
        in the last war, whereas Berlin is very modern with lots of newer structures.
        Our first stop in Berlin was the Berlin wall memorial and the West Side Gallery.
        We took a boat tour that allowed us to see museum island and pointed out other government
        buildings. We also toured the Reichstag dome, the Brandenburg Gate, DDR Museum
        and Checkpoint Charlie.
